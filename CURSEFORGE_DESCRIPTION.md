# Lightman's Currency: FTB Claim Economy

**Lightman's Currency: FTB Claim Economy** connects [Lightman's Currency](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lightmans-currency) with [FTB Chunks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftb-chunks-neoforge) and [FTB Teams](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ftb-teams-neoforge), turning chunk claiming and land protection into an economy-driven system. Claiming costs money, protections require ongoing upkeep, and teams can declare war on each other — with upkeep scaling accordingly.

> **Minecraft:** 1.21.1 · **Loader:** NeoForge · **Side:** Both (required on server and client)

## Features

### Paid Chunk Claiming
- Claiming a chunk draws funds from the player's or team's bank account. The price is server-configurable.
- Unclaiming a chunk refunds a configurable percentage of the claim price.
- The first *N* chunks per team or player can be made free (configurable).

### Two Chunk Types: Build and Land
Every claimed chunk is either a **Build chunk** or a **Land chunk**.

| | Build chunk | Land chunk |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Base, builds, infrastructure | Territory, borders, open land |
| **Available protections** | Mob griefing, explosions, PvP, block interact/edit, entity interact | Block interact and block edit only |
| **Upkeep billing** | Per chunk | Per group of N chunks (cheaper for large territories) |
| **Switch** | Alt + click/drag in the FTB Chunks map | Same |

### Team Bank Accounts
When an FTB party is created, Lightman's Currency: FTB Claim Economy automatically creates a linked Lightman's Currency bank account for it. The account mirrors the team hierarchy at all times:

- **Team owner → Account owner**
- **Officers → Account admins**
- **Members → Account members**

The account cannot be deleted while the party is alive. When the party disbands, any remaining balance and chunk refunds are distributed to each member's personal account.

Joining a party dissolves your personal claims and refunds them to your personal account.

### Protection Upkeep
Protecting your land is not free — protections must be paid for periodically (configurable; default: every hour).

**Upkeep formula:**
```
cost = base_protection_price × number_of_billable_chunks
```

Each active protection adds a per-chunk price to the base rate. Prices per protection are independently configurable.

**If the account runs out of money:**
- Protections are stripped one by one in a configurable priority order.
- Once the balance is restored, protections are automatically re-enabled in reverse order.
- Changing a protection setting that would make upkeep unaffordable is blocked at the UI — the toggle simply does not apply and an alert appears.

Changes to protections and force-loads are queued to the **next upkeep period** to prevent mid-period exploits.

### War System *(optional, server-configurable)*
Teams with claimed chunks can declare war on each other. War raises upkeep costs:

- **Incoming wars** increase your upkeep exponentially: `base × Σ(l^i)` for *i* incoming wars, where *l* is the configurable war cost multiplier.
- **Outgoing wars** cost you the target team's base upkeep scaled by `l^n` (where *n* is the ordinal of that war).

War declarations and endings are queued to the next upkeep period. If a team cannot pay full upkeep, outgoing wars are frozen until the balance is restored. The war system can be disabled entirely per server.

The **War screen** (accessible from Team Settings) shows active and pending wars, upkeep cost breakdowns, and target vulnerability indicators (unprotected block edit, explosions, PvP).

### Force-Load Upkeep
Enabling force-load on a chunk is free, but each force-loaded chunk adds a periodic charge.

### In-Game UI Extensions
- **Claim prices** and your current balance are displayed directly in the FTB Chunks map UI.
- **Protection prices** are shown next to each toggle in the FTB Teams config screen.
- **Pending state indicators** show queued changes (e.g. "→ Ally pending").

3. Start the server (or single-player world). The mod generates its config file automatically on first launch.
4. Configure the mod to your liking (see below).

> **Important:** The mod must be installed on **both the server and every client** — it registers custom network payloads and client-side UI mixins.

## Server Configuration

The config file is generated at:
```
world/serverconfig/lc_claim_economy-server.toml
```

Reload it by restarting the server or using `/reload` (some values apply immediately).

## Getting Started (In-Game Tutorial)

### Step 1 — Get some money
Players need a Lightman's Currency bank account with a positive balance. Place an **ATM** or use your wallet to deposit money. As a server operator, you can give money directly:
```
/lcbank give players <playername> <amount>
```

### Step 2 — Claim your first chunks
Open the FTB Chunks map (`M` by default). Click a chunk to claim it. The claim price is deducted from your bank account automatically. If you don't have enough, the claim is rejected with a chat message.

Unclaiming a chunk refunds part of the price (60% by default).

### Step 3 — Switch chunks to Land (optional)
By default all claimed chunks are **Build chunks**. To mark some as **Land chunks** (cheaper upkeep, restricted protections), hold **Alt** and click or drag over chunks in the FTB Chunks map. A confirmation message appears in chat.

Land chunks use separate block interact and block edit protection settings, visible in the FTB Teams config under *"Land Chunk Protection"*.

### Step 4 — Enable protections
Open your FTB Teams settings and navigate to the protection properties. Each protection shows its per-chunk price next to the toggle. Enable protections you want to pay for. If your balance is too low to afford the new upkeep, the change is blocked and reverted.

Protections take effect immediately; the upkeep for them will be charged at the next billing period.

### Step 5 — Set up a party (for teams)
Create a party via FTB Teams. Lightman's Currency: FTB Claim Economy automatically creates a linked bank account for the team. Fund the team account through any ATM (select the team account from the account list).

Only **owners and officers** can claim chunks, force-load them, or manage war for the team.

### Step 6 — Force-loading chunks
In the FTB Chunks map, enable force-load on any of your claimed chunks as usual. There is no upfront cost, but each force-loaded chunk adds a charge to the next upkeep bill.

### Step 7 — Monitor upkeep
When upkeep is charged, a chat message summarises the payment. Click **[See more]** in that message to view a full breakdown including which protections were active and what each cost.

Owners and officers can also run:
```
/upkeep details
```
to see the most recent breakdown at any time.

To see the order in which protections would be dropped if upkeep fails:
```
/upkeep priority
```

### Step 8 — War (optional)
If the war system is enabled, open your FTB Teams settings and click the **War** button (visible to owners and officers). The war screen shows:

- **Declared war on you** — incoming wars and the upkeep penalty each adds.
- **War you declared** — your active outgoing wars and their costs.
- **Declare war on** — all eligible teams you can target.

Click a team row to declare war (pending until the next upkeep period) or to queue an end to an existing war. War costs are shown in the tooltips before confirming.

> Declaring war increases your periodic upkeep. Make sure your team account can cover the new total before committing.

## FAQ

**Q: Why was my protection disabled?**  
A: Your team's bank account did not have enough balance to pay upkeep. Top up the account and the protection will be re-enabled at the next billing cycle automatically.

**Q: Can members claim chunks?**  
A: No. Only team owners and officers can claim, unclaim, or force-load chunks on behalf of the team.

**Q: What happens when my party disbands?**  
A: All claimed chunks are unclaimed (with the configured refund), the remaining balance in the team account is distributed to members, and the team account is deleted.

**Q: Can I disable the war system?**  
A: Yes. Set `warEnabled = false` in the server config. The war button disappears from the client UI automatically.

**Q: Where is the config file?**  
A: `world/serverconfig/lc_claim_economy-server.toml` on a dedicated server, or `saves/<world>/serverconfig/lc_claim_economy-server.toml` in single-player.
